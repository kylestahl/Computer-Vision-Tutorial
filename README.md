# Computer Vision Tutorials
A few YouTube videos recently caught my eye that show experts explaining complex topics at 5 different levels of difficulty. 
Like this one for blockchain: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYip_Vuv8J0&t=2s
or this one for harmony in music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRkgK4jfi6M&t=1s
This inspired me to create a walk through of computer vision using Python at three different levels of difficulty: 
1) Basic statistics using logistic regression
2) Standard machine learning process and neural networks
3) Deep learning and convolutional neural networks
... 4 will be a tensorflow run through (in progress)
